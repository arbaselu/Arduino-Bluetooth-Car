Bluetooth-Controlled Car with Arduino
Project Description
This project demonstrates how to build and control a car using an Arduino board and a Bluetooth module.

Required Components
Arduino Uno board
HC-05 Bluetooth module
L298N motor driver
2 DC motors
Samsung 35E 18650 3500mAh 8A 
Some wires
Circuit Diagram
A detailed diagram showing the connections between the Arduino, Bluetooth module, motor driver, and motors can be found here(link).

Installation and Setup

Ensure you have the latest version of the Arduino IDE installed.
Connect your Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.
Open the Arduino IDE and load the source code from this project.
Select the correct board model and corresponding port from the Tools menu.

Usage
After uploading the code to the Arduino board and assembling the circuit, connect the Bluetooth module to a mobile device and use a compatible app to send control commands to the car.For example: Arduino Car.Link in video description.

Source Code
The source code is structured into several sections: setup, loop, and functions for controlling the car's direction. Each function is documented to explain its functionality.
